Deployment
	Build Command:
		ng build --prod
			1. compiles type-script code to java-script
			2. compiles all templates to java-script instruction.
			3. optimizes code and generates 'dist' folder.
		
	Environment variable configuration:
		For Dev: src\environments\environment.ts
		
		For Production: src\environments\environment.prod.ts
	
		Global variable/values, API keys can be configured here to be used in application.
		Like FireBase service Key can be stored here.
		
	Add required values to src\environments\environment.ts and it will automatically swaped to environment.prod.ts file while building application.		
		export const environment = {
		  production: false,
		  firebaseAPIKey: 'AIzaSyB63LmjJ9bTcBV11qmUHRnzqA26gb1gXPc'
		};
		
	In service class this configuration can be accessed as below:
		import { environment } from '../../environments/environment';
		access as: 
		'https://www.googleapis.com/identitytoolkit/v3/relyingparty/signupNewUser?key=' + environment.firebaseAPIKey,
		
Deploying or Hosting Angular Application:
	Hosting on FireBase
		https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting
		
		Install the Firebase CLI
			1. Install Node.js using one of the following options. Installing Node.js automatically installs npm.
			2. Install the Firebase CLI using npm by running:
				$npm install -g firebase-tools
			3. Sign into Firebase using your Google account by running:
				$firebase login
			4. To test that authentication worked (and to list all of your Firebase projects), run the following command:
				$firebase list
			5. Connect your project with firebase using init command
				$cd c:\RecipeBook
				$firebase init
				(choose approfriate options)
			6. Deploy the application by below command which will give a hosted URL
				$firebase deploy

Server Routing vs Browser Routing
	When deploying your Angular app, it's really important to make sure that your server (like S3) is configured to always serve the index.html file.
