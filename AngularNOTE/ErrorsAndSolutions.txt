	Step 1 : Go to package.json and modify "rxjs": "^6.0.0" to "rxjs": "6.0.0"
	Step 2 Run npm update in your project.
		There is no need to change the typescript version. (Mine: "typescript": "~2.7.2")
	Edit: If you are using rxjs-compat then you also need to do following in order to fixed the issue. change the rxjs-compat version from "rxjs-compat": "^6.2.2" to "rxjs-compat": "6.2.2"
